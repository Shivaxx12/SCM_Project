    <h1 class="top-h1">Zeus Botnet Malware</h1>
    <p class="top-para">Zeus, ZeuS, or Zbot is a Trojan horse malware package that runs on versions of Microsoft Windows. While it can be used to carry out many malicious and criminal tasks, it is often used to steal banking information by man-in-the-browser keystroke logging and form grabbing. It is also used to install the CryptoLocker ransomware.[1] Zeus is spread mainly through drive-by downloads and phishing schemes. First identified in July 2007 when it was used to steal information from the United States Department of Transportation,[2] it became more widespread in March 2009. In June 2009 security company Prevx discovered that Zeus had compromised over 74,000 FTP accounts on websites of such companies as the Bank of America, NASA, Monster.com, ABC, Oracle, Play.com, Cisco, Amazon, and BusinessWeek.[3] Similarly to Koobface, Zeus has also been used to trick victims of technical support scams into giving the scam artists money through pop-up messages that claim the user has a virus, when in reality they might have no viruses at all. The scammers may use programs such as Command prompt or Event viewer to make the user believe that their computer is infected.</p>

    <h1 class="semi-h1">Detection</h1>
    <p class="semi-para">Zeus is very difficult to detect even with up-to-date antivirus and other security software as it hides itself using stealth techniques.[5] It is considered that this is the primary reason why the Zeus malware has become the largest botnet on the Internet: Damballa estimated that the malware infected 3.6 million PCs in the U.S. in 2009.[6] Security experts are advising that businesses continue to offer training to users to teach them to not to click on hostile or suspicious links in emails or Web sites, and to keep antivirus protection up to date. Antivirus software does not claim to reliably prevent infection; for example Symantec's Browser Protection says that it can prevent "some infection attempts"</p>

    <h1 class="middle-h1">Zeus Crimeware Toolkit</h1>
    
    <p class="middle-body-para">The Zeus crimeware toolkit is a set of programs which have been designed to setup a botnet over a high-scaled networked infrastructure. Generally, the Zeus botnet aims to make machines behave as spying agents with the intent of getting financial benefits. The Zeus malware has the ability to log inputs that are entered by the user as well as to capture and alter data that are displayed into web-pages [13]. Stolen data can contain email addresses, passwords, online banking accounts, credit card numbers, and transaction authentication numbers. In our analysis, we examine the Zeus crimeware toolkit v.1.2.4.2, which is considered as the latest stable publicly available version in the underground community. The overall structure of the Zeus crimeware toolkit consists of five components:</p>
    <ul class="middle-body-list">
        
        <li>A control panel which contains a set of PHP scripts that are used to monitor the botnet and collect the stolen information into MySQL database and then display it to the botmaster. It also allows the botmaster to monitor, control, and manage bots that are registered within the botnet</li>

        <li>Configuration files that are used to customize the botnet parameters. It involves two files: the configuration file config.txt that lists the basic information, and the web injects filewebinjects.txt that identifies the targeted websites and defines the content injection rules.</li>
            
        <li>A generated encrypted configuration file config.bin, which holds an encrypted version of the configuration parameters of the botnet</li>
            
        <li>A generated malware binary file bot.exe, which is considered as the bot binary file that infects the victims' machines.</li>
        
        <li>A builder program that generate two files: the encrypted configuration file config.bin and the malware (actual bot) binary file bot.exe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="bottom-h1">Zeus Botnet Network Analysis</h1>
    
    <p class="bottom-para">In this section, we explain the network communication that occurs between the C&C server (the server containing the control panel) and an infected machine. Such analysis can be used to write IDS rules and anti-virus detection routines. In order to perform the network analysis, we built a sandbox environment to collect and analyze the network traces that are generated from the communication between the C&C server and one of the bot instances. We configured a web server, which act as the C&C server and the drop location. This server hosts all resources that are required to operate the botnet (config.bin file, PHP scripts and the MySQL database). To customize the malware, we used the builder program to generate the malware binary file which is configured to communicate with a C&C server. Within our environment, fake websites are generated to reflect real scenarios of botnet attacks. All necessary entries of the configuration file as well as the web injects scripts are modified to target the fake website. After infecting a machine with the bot binary file, we collected network traces for one day. During this session, the user of the infected machine visited the targeted website and then used login credentials, personal information, and credit card information for testing purposes.</p>

    <p class="bottom-para">By analyzing the bot network communications, we can learn the overall behavior of the Zeus botnet. The network behavior of the Zeus botnet constitutes a starting point, where we can dig into the crimeware toolkit functionalities. Since the Zeus botnet is based on the HTTP protocol, it uses a pull- method to synchronize the botnet communications. From the collected network traces between a bot and a C&C server, we observe that the bot periodically checks specific server for an up-to-date configuration and bot binary files. Moreover, the HTTP communication messages between the two entities are encrypted. By observing the network trace, we managed to determine the following communication pattern between the C&C server and the infected machine
    </p></div>
    <div class="list-div">
    <ul class="bottom-list">
        
        <li>The infected client starts the communication by sending a request message GET /config.bin to the C&C server. This message is a request to fetch the configuration file for the botnet.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The C&C server replies with the encrypted configuration file config.bin.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The client receives the encrypted configuration file and decrypts its content by using an encryption key, which is embedded inside the bot binary file.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Situation where, the botmaster wants to involve the infected machine to manage the botnet, the infected machine has to provide its external IP address and report any use of Network Address Translation (NAT). In order to know the external IP address that is seen by the botnet servers, the infected machine makes a request to a specific server. Afterward, this server informs the infected machine about their externally facing IP address. The server’s URL is provided in the static configuration file.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The bot posts the stolen information and its update status reports to the C&C server POST/gate.php.</li>

        <h1 class="final-para-h1">Conclusion</h1>
        
        <p class="final-para">The Zeus crimeware toolkit is an advanced tool used to generate very effective malware that facilitates criminal activ- ities. The integrated tootkit technology harden the detection of the malware at the host level. Similarly, the use of encrypted HTTP messages for C&C makes it difficult to detect any clear behavior at the network level. Moreover, the multiple levels of malware obfuscation presents a burden in front the analysts to find information about the C&C servers or to generate binary signatures. In this work, we presented a detailed reverse engineering analysis of the Zeus crimeware toolkit to unveil its underlying architecture and enable its mitigation. We have also designed a tool to automat the recovery of the encryption key and the extraction of the configuration information from the binary bot executables. Furthermore, we provided a breakdown for the structure of the Zeus botnet network messages.</p>

        <p class="final-para">Our analysis of the C&C communications indicates that the RC4 algorithm is used in a poor way to encrypt these communications (keystream reuse). In addition to the knowl- edge of the network messages structure, we can launch an active countermeasures by interacting with the botnets servers using the extracted encryption key. For example, we can inject falsified information into the botnet communications for various purposes, such as defaming the botnet business model by reducing the effectiveness of their services [17], [18]. A useful extension to our work is to use the extracted encryption key mechanism in order to analyze and track down the Zeus C&C servers or to defame the toolkit, e.g., by returning fake (invalid) credit card numbers.</p>
