    <p class="top-para">Redline malware was first observed in March 2020, but it continues to be the most prominent cyber threat impacting users worldwide in 2021. According to the AnyRun trend tracker, 1,473 samples were submitted onto the online sandbox in September 2021, an increase of 377 samples in contrast to August, with a total of 2,600 domains and 405 unique IP addresses.</p>

    <p class="top-para">Redline is a piece of malware that has been updated during the last few months, with features for credentials exfiltration and cryptocurrency wallets, browser information and FTP authentication data. It also collects information about the infected machine, such as OS information, system hardware, processes, system language and more. Capabilities to load remote payloads and a SOAP protocol for C2 communication were also implemented — a clear sign this malicious piece should be put under the cyber radar.</p>

    <h1 class="middle-h1">Technical Summary</h1>
    
    <p class="middle-body-para">
        Configuration Extraction: RedLine comes with embedded configuration, in this variant, the configuration is Base64 encoded plus an additional layer of XOR encryption with hard-coded key. These configuration contains the C&C server and the malware Botnet ID , which it will communicate with to exfiltrate gathered information, and also for further remote commands.<br><br>
        C2 Communication: After extracting the C&C and before doing anything, RedLine will check if there is a possibility to reach its C&C server. If there is an available connection, RedLine will then try to obtain the malicious Scan Settings. These scan arguments contain flags that will be used to determine which information to be stolen. Moreover, the obtained scan arguments contain tuning parameters, to specify desired data assets. For instance, search patterns to specify certain files to be exfiltrated, etc.<br><br>
        Host Profiling: RedLine will gather information about the infected host, in order to decide further actions. Mostly relying on Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), it harvests and generates the following information: Hardware ID, Usernames, OS version, Installed languages, Installed programs, Current running processes, Anti-malware products, Graphics card info, Victim's Location, IP address, etc. In addition to all these, RedLine contains functions to exclude Blacklisted countries as well as Blocked IPs from infection.<br><br>
        Information Stealing: Here lies the bulk of its functionality. As being an information stealer, based on the obtained scan arguments, RedLine can exfiltrates the following information:</p>
        
        <ul class="middle-body-list">
        
            <li>Files: Any specified files in the following directories: ProgramData, Program Files, Program Files (x86).</li>
        
            <li>Browsers: Login credentials, Cookies, Auto-fill fields used by  websites, and Credit card details.</li>
        
            <li>Crypto Wallets: Credentials of: Armory, Exodus, Ethereum, Monero, Atomic, BinanceChain, and a lot more.</li>
        
            <li>VPN Clients: Credentials of the following VPN clients: NordVPN, ProtonVPN, and OpenVPN.</li>
        
            <li>Gaming Clients: It's targeting the credentials of the famous Valve's Steam gaming platform.</li>
        
            <li>Instant Messengers: Currently it's targeting Telegram session data and Discord tokens.</li>

    <h1 class="bottom-h1">Understanding Redline malware</h1>
    
    <p class="bottom-para">Redline malware is a recent malware written in C# with notable growth in 2021 and disseminated using templates related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It includes modules of stealing credentials and collecting information from the infected machine and the capability to download remote files and execute additional payloads, including other malware.</p>

    <p class="bottom-body-para">In general, users should be trained against threats of this nature and focus on the social engineering schemas that proliferate via email. The email continues to be the most used vehicle for distributing malicious campaigns in the wild, especially messages with hardcoded URLs or files attached that can lead to the deployment of malicious payloads.</p>
        
    <p class="bottom-body-para">Let's take malware protection seriously and stop from scratch the dissemination of these kinds of threats with practical awareness training.</p>

    <img class="hacker-walking-right" src="Index files/hacker-walking-right-vector.jpg" alt="hacker-walking-right-vector">
    
    <p class="final-para">Using your web browser to store your login credentials is tempting and convenient, but doing so is risky even without malware infections.</p>

    <p class="final-para">By doing so, a local or remote actor with access to your machine could steal all your passwords in a matter of minutes.
    </p>  
    
    <p class="final-para">Instead, it would be best to use a dedicated password manager that stores everything in an encrypted vault and requests the master password to unlock it.</p>
        
    <p class="final-para">Moreover, you should configure specific rules for sensitive websites such as e-banking portals or corporate asset webpages, requiring manual credential input.</p>
        
    <p class="final-para">Finally, activate multi-factor authentication wherever this is available, as this additional step can save you from account take-over incidents even if your credentials have been compromised</p>
