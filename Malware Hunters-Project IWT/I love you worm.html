    <h1 class="top-h1">I Love You</h1>
    
    <p class="top-para">ILOVEYOU, sometimes referred to as Love Bug or Love Letter for you, is a computer worm that infected over ten million Windows personal computers on and after 5 May 2000. It started spreading as an email message with the subject line "ILOVEYOU" and the attachment "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs."[1] At the time, Windows computers often hid the latter file extension ("VBS," a type of interpreted file) by default because it is an extension for a file type that Windows knows, leading unwitting users to think it was a normal text file. Opening the attachment activates the Visual Basic script. First, the worm inflicts damage on the local machine, overwriting random files (including Office files and image files; however, it hides MP3 files instead of deleting them). Then, the worm copies itself to all addresses in the Windows Address Book used by Microsoft Outlook, allowing it to spread much faster than any other previous email worm
    <br><br>
    Onel de Guzman, a then-24-year-old resident of Manila, Philippines, created the malware. Because there were no laws in the Philippines against making malware at the time of its creation, the Philippine Congress enacted Republic Act No. 8792, otherwise known as the E-Commerce Law, in July 2000 to discourage future iterations of such activity. However, the Constitution of the Philippines bans ex post facto laws, and as such, de Guzman could not be prosecuted..</p>

    <h1 class="middle-h1">What does I LOVE YOU do?</h1>
    <p class="middle-body-para">Malware encompasses all types of malicious software, including viruses, and cybercriminals use it for many reasons, such as:</p>
    <ul class="middle-body-list">
        <li>When it is executed, ILOVEYOU first copies itself to the Windows system directory as MSKernel32.vbs and LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs. It also copies itself to the windows directory as Win32DLL.vbs.</li>
        
        <li>Then it adds itself to the registry, so it will be executed when the system is restarted. The registry keys that it adds are: 
        <img class="list-img1" src="I love you worm files/ily1.jpg"> 
        </li>
        
        <li>Next, the worm replaces the Microsoft Internet Explorer home page with a link that points to an executable program called WIN-BUGSFIX.exe. If the file is downloaded, the worm adds this to the registry as well, causing the program to execute when you restart your system.<br><br>The executable part that the ILOVEYOU worm downloads from the web is a password-stealing Trojan horse. On startup, the Trojan tries to find a hidden window named BAROK.... If it is present, the Trojan exits immediately; if not, the main routine takes control. The Trojan checks for the "WinFAT32" subkey in the following registry key:<br><img class="list-img2" src="I love you worm files/ily2.jpg"><br> If the "WinFAT32" subkey key is not found, the Trojan creates it, copies itself to the \Windows\System\ directory as WINFAT32.EXE, and then runs the file from that location. The above registry key modification makes the Trojan become active every time Windows starts.</li>
        
        <li>Next, the Trojan sets the Internet Explorer startup page to "about:blank". After that, the Trojan tries to find and delete the following keys: <img class="list-img3" src="I love you worm files/ily3.jpg"></li>
        
        <li>Then the Trojan registers a new window class, creates a hidden window titled BAROK..., and remains resident in Windows memory as a hidden application.<br><br>Immediately after startup and when timer counters reach certain values, the Trojan loads the MPR.DLL library, calls the WNetEnumCashedPasswords function and sends stolen RAS passwords and all cached Windows passwords to mailme@super.net.ph, an email address that most likely belongs to the Trojan's author. The Trojan uses the smtp.super.net.ph mail server to send email messages. The email message's subject line is "Barok... email.passwords.sender.trojan".
        The author's copyright message appears inside the Trojan's body:
        <img class="list-img4" src="I love you worm files/ily4.jpg">
        </li>
        
        <li>After that, the worm creates an HTML file called LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.HTM in the Windows system directory. This file contains the worm, and it will be sent using mIRC whenever the user joins an IRC channel.</li>
        
        <li>Then the worm will use Outlook to mass mail itself to everyone in each address book. The message that it sends will have a "Subject:" line of "ILOVEYOU", the body will say "kindly check the attached LOVELETTER coming from me.", and an attachment called LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs. ILOVEYOU sends the message once to each recipient. After a message has been sent, it adds a marker to the registry and does not mass mail itself any more.</li>
        
        <li>The virus then searches for certain file types on all folders on all local and remote drives and overwrites them with its own code. The files that are overwritten have either .vbs or .vbe extensions. The virus will create a new file with the same name but using a .vbs extension and delete the original for all files with the following extensions: .js, .jse, .css, .wsh, .sct, and .hta.
        </li>
        
        <li>Next, the virus adds a new file next to, and deletes the original of, all files with the following extensions: .jpg, .jpeg, .mp3, and .mp2. As an example, for a picture named pic.jpg, the virus will create a new file called pic.jpg.vbs and delete the original.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="middle-body-para">ILOVEYOU was found globally in the wild on May 4, 2000, and appears to be of Philippine origin. At the beginning of the code, the virus contains the following text:</p>

        <h1 class="final-para-h1">How to Manually remove it</h1>
        <p class="final-para">To manually remove the ILOVEYOU virus, follow these directions:</p>
        <img src="I love you worm files/ily8.jpg">
        <ul class="final-list">
            
            <li>Delete these registry entries:
                <img src="I love you worm files/ily9.jpg">
            </li>
            
            <li>If your Windows system directory contains the file WinFAT32.exe, delete the following registry entries:
                <img src="I love you worm files/ily10.jpg">
            </li>
            
            <li>Delete LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.HTM and LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT .
                <br><br>
                Note:Search all non-removable drives (hard disks and network drives) for the files LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.HTM and LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT, and delete all occurrences. Do not open these files.</li>
            
            <li>Look for the following files:
                <img src="I love you worm files/ily11.jpg"><br><br>
                If your computer contains any of the above files, the virus will create a file called script.ini in the folder of that file. Delete all occurrences of script.ini in these folders.
            </li>
            
            <li>The virus will overwrite all files with the following extensions so that they contain the virus file's content:
                <img src="I love you worm files/ily12.jpg"><br><br>
                The MS-DOS name of the files has been changed so that the file is associated with the Windows scripting host. This means that if you double-click or in any other way activate these files, the virus will run again. You will not be able to recreate the original contents of the files (at least not through Windows). You could try to contact a disk rescue company to help you before proceeding.
                <br><br>
                If you do not choose disk rescuing measures, this leaves you with little choice but to delete all of the files of the type listed above. Possibly, you may be able to reinstall the affected applications; however, the effect on your computer could be severe.
                <br><br>
                Note: In addition to your hard disk, remember to check the network drives to which your computer has access. Check files before you delete them. Affected files will have extension .vbs and be 11K in size. You can also use the file date as an indication, comparing it to when you received the virus.
            </li>
            
            <li>The virus changes the Internet Explorer start page to:
                <img src="I love you worm files/ily13.jpg">
                <br>You must change the Internet Explorer registry key to:
                <img src="I love you worm files/ily14.jpg">
            </li>
